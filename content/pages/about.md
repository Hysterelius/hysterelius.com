I am an independent developer based in Australia who loves to work on a variety of personal projects. Though my bread and butter is Python development, with my passion being small projects. Currently, I am learning the wonderful (and wacky) language of Rust. 

But over the years I have used JavaScript, Python and Rust, with Lua mixed in.

This site is just a collection of my thoughts and interests at the time of writing.
