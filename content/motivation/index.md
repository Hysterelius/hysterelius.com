Ah, motivation, often mimicked but never copied.

Its secret formula driving the engines of our minds.

## My motivation
I have found it hard in recent years to keep motivation for certain things, especially for my programming projects, that's why my commit graph looks like this:

{{ img(src="commit_graph.png" alt="Very empty commit graph for Hysterelius") }}

And why I currently have 3 unfinished blog posts in various states of completeness.

It may sound like I am completely demotivated (I am not), but I hope this post is the first in a string of things to change that.

## How I motivate
Basically:
- Do all my work at 10pm (somehow, that is most productive time) ðŸ¦‰
- Blast classical music ðŸŽ§
- Drink tea â˜•
- Write a blog post about motivation ðŸ˜‚
- Watch the same [TedEd video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II5h6uJPvvs) about motivation on repeat ðŸ“º

## Conclusion
You're not alone in feeling demotivated, so I hope you can find your own steps to get motivated again and maybe I have motivated you to reflect on your own motivation journey :)
