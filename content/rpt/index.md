## Introduction
Radiopharmaceutical therapy also known as RPTs, is a novel way to treat a horrific disease – cancer. Being around for more than 80 years, radiotracers, radioactive cancer indicators, are coming into the modern age with their evolution into cancer treatment. There is a currently a cancer in disguise behind me, do you think you can spot it? Radiopharmaceuticals provide a way for cancer specialists, oncologists, to target cancer cells directly with radiation. This targeted radiation is both more accurate and less damaging to the patient. RPTs use the bodies’ natural processes like biological delivery mechanisms, to target cancer. Did you see the cancer? Imagine now if you were trying to build medication for cancer, and now can you see the difficulty in treating cancer? 


## Meet Cancer
Cancer is a complex and devastating disease that arises from the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of abnormal cells in the body. The normal function of cells in the body is to divide and replace damaged or worn-out tissues, but in the case of cancer, this process goes awry. Cancer cells divide and replicate rapidly, often much faster than healthy cells, leading to the formation of tumours or abnormal masses of tissue. Additionally, cancer cells may mutate and develop abnormalities in their DNA, preventing the cell from repairing itself or from undergoing programmed cell death, known as apoptosis.

The inability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death means that they can continue to proliferate unchecked, consuming the body's resources and leading to the development of more and more abnormal cells. As the cancer cells grow and spread, they can damage healthy tissues and organs in the body, leading to a range of symptoms and complications. Over time, if left untreated, cancer can be fatal, as the cancer cells can overwhelm the body's natural defences and ultimately lead to organ failure. Despite significant advances in cancer treatment and research, cancer remains a significant health challenge, and ongoing efforts are focused on developing new therapies and strategies to combat this disease.

## Alternatives
To combat cancer, scientists and oncologists have developed a range of cancer treatments. The two most common cancer treatments: chemo and radiation therapy, both kill human cells – causing long-term damage to the body and exposing the patient to trauma due to the repetitive treatment. Chemo and radiation therapy don’t work well on large clumps of cancer, as the medication cannot infiltrate it.

        Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful drugs that target and kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. These drugs can be administered orally or intravenously and are designed to kill cancer cells by disrupting their DNA or by preventing them from dividing and multiplying. While chemotherapy is highly effective at killing cancer cells, it can also damage healthy cells in the body, leading to a range of side effects. These side effects can include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and increased susceptibility to infection.

        Radiation therapy, on the other hand, uses high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. This can be done using external radiation, where a machine directs a beam of radiation at the tumor from outside the body, or internal radiation, where radioactive material is implanted directly into the tumor. Like chemotherapy, radiation therapy can also damage healthy cells in the body, leading to side effects such as fatigue, skin irritation, and nausea.

        Radiopharmaceuticals are a way to combat both the issues with these medications, RPTs can use biological processes, like antibodies, to deliver radiation straight to the cancer. This radiation damages the DNA of cancer so severely that it cannot replicate and dies. As radiation is an electromagnetic wave it can pass through the cells killing cancer around the original targeted cell. This means that RPTs are even more effective on large clumps of cancer, so they can be used fittingly in the late states of cancer. RPTs have been described as “radioactive chemotherapy” as it has the benefits of both therapies. RPTs usually have half-lives of 1 hour so the radiation doesn’t stay in the body for too long, meaning that RPTs need to be produced right before use.

#### Effective
You may be asking yourself were does radiation come into this picture? Well, with radiation, <abbr title="a doctor who specialises in cancer">oncologists</abbr> can actively disrupt cancer cells. As cancer cells cannot commit apoptosis, controlled death, they have to be forcefully be killed. Radiation targets the DNA within the cells, destroying it to such a degree that the cell cannot grow nor replicate - effectively stopping cancer function. Compared to its radiation therapt brethren, <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are able to target large clusters of cells. As they target the cells on their outside, with unidirectional radiation. This does mean that <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are less effective at targetting singular cells, due to the inherent randomness in the radiation path, though is counteracted by the fact it can work effectively in clusters of singular cells, achieving treatment.

#### Cost effective
The products that make up radiopharmaceuticals themselves are relatively cheap, as the component products are readily available due to their already high use in the nuclear medicine space.

#### Self evaluating
Arguably the biggest benefit of <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are the ability to see in **real time** the effectiveness of the treatment, this mean you can tell on the day of the treatment whether another treatment is needed. This reduces the managerial burden and suffering for patients as treatments can be planned ahead for maximum quality of life.

This benefit all stems from <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> evolution from nuclear medicine, a technology that has been around for 90 years! All this means that by either being placed in a SPECT or PET machine, the <abbr title="a doctor who specialises in cancer">oncologist</abbr> can actively monitor your treatment, see if it is working, if there are more outbreaks and plan future doses. This is by far <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPT's</abbr> biggest strength as they provide real-time, personalised information on treatment success. This can overall benefit patient outcomes and wellbeing.

If were the cancer were to 'evolve' per se, the <abbr title="a doctor who specialises in cancer">oncologist</abbr> would be able to tell in real-time that cancer is not responding to the patient. They would then be able to adapt this for the next treatment.

#### Safe
Radiopharmaceuticals are specifically designed to interface with only one type of cancer, through a biological linking device such as an antibody or a molecule as they are biological in nature, they can be adapted to the ever evolving cancer. This specific interface increases accuracy as it is less likely to connect with a body cell.

#### Quick
Compared to chemotherapy, <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are far quicker as they rely less on biological mechanism to <u>transport</u> the medication, instead they go straight to the cancer environment determined by nuclear imaging through intravenous methods. This means that <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are able to quickly travel to target sites and treat the cancer. While chemotherapy can become a laborious process for the patient. Chemotherapy requires heavy modelling to understand the biological delivery mechanisms, this means that they only have success rate of targeted biological agents within clinical trials is only 3%!   

#### Knowledge base
yes


Compared to both radiation therapy and chemotherapy, <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are the clear winner. In contrast to radiation therapy, <abbr title="radiopharmaceuticals">RPTs</abbr> are able to target large clusters of cells - effectively targeting late stages of cancer. While 

RPT cancer treatment has many benefits. There is a large knowledge base around radioactive cancer treatments, helping oncologists adapt. RPTs have high accuracy, rarely targeting normal cells. Compared to chemo, RPTs can quickly saturate cancer sites and only need 1 to 2 rounds to fully treat the cancer. This medication itself is relatively cheap to produce. Arguably the biggest benefit, RPTs provide real-time feedback on the effectiveness of the cancer therapy. As they are based off radiotracers, they produce low-frequency radiation that can be picked up by non-invasive scans (SPECT) to see the effectiveness of the treatments. 

 
## Limitations
RPTs do come with some inherent limitations. There is a negative stigma associated with radiation and especially ingested radiation, impacting RPT development. RPTs are complex to manufacture, requiring hospitals to make them on site due to their short half-life. They need a large upfront investment as they require particle accelerators. RPTs are also complex to design, requiring oncologists to consider all interactions with the body.  RPTs have administrative issues as they are radioactive and need special bureaucratic procedures. 

 
## Implications
As shown, there are clear implications for RPTs as a novel way to treat cancer. RPTs have the potential to revolutionise the way that cancers are treated, by selectively introducing radiation to cancer cells so much that it kills them while minimising the impact to the regular cells around it. 

One study concluded that this therapy led to an 80% reduction in cancer related deaths. RPTs will be able to reduce the trauma for families and friends as their loved ones have a higher chance of survival. 

 
## Current state
So, you’ve probably been wondering this whole time why I haven’t heard of RPTs until now? RPTs have yet to be introduced into standard cancer therapy due to the associated complexity. This therapy needs to work effectively for all patients, and it must be verified it won’t cause damage to normal cells. With RPTs relying on complex equipment, development is therefore slow. More funding and research will be needed to develop this therapy in its entirety. The RPT industry is relatively new and only a small number of scientists are researching them. Successful clinical use of RPTs will require faster adoption and evaluation from all parties. 


Radiopharmaceutical therapy has the potential to revolutionise our world as they provide oncologists a novel and effective way to treat cancer in 21st century. RPTs promise to decrease the mortality of cancer. Thanks.
